        <h1>Lets Help Those Who Are More Needed</h1>
        <h4>
          Many times many people think that if I don't help that person then
          maybe no one will help him and no one will ask him without me then it
          is very wrong. Anyone can need help. If you don't help anyone today
          the day you needed help and no one helped you then you will know the
          value of help.

        <p>
          One should never win favor by helping anyone. Helping a person should
          be considered a service. If you ever get a chance to serve someone
          then you should consider yourself lucky that this service came to you.
          With the help of someone in need you will not lose anything. God will
          give you more progress and will give you ten times the reward.
